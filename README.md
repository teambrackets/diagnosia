### Symptom Checker
Dataset is provided by **[Columbia University](https://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html)**  and is a knowledge database of disease-symptom associations generated by an automated method based on information in textual discharge summaries of patients at New York Presbyterian Hospital admitted during 2004.  The first column shows the disease, the second the number of discharge summaries containing a positive and current mention of the disease, and the associated symptom. Associations for the 150 most frequent diseases based on these notes were computed and the symptoms are shown ranked based on the strength of association

### VisionTracker
Due to the increased work from home oppurtunities, many of us fail to maintain a good eye level, which is why we have implemented a full fledged vision tracking system to tell the user if their eye level is good or bad.
