# Diagnosia
Diagnosia is a cutting edge healthcare web-app which includes features such as Symptom Checker, Prescription Generator, Skin Cancer Detection, DocFinder, VisionTracker & BMI calculator.

## Motive
In today's evolving healthcare landscape, demand for accessible, efficient, and precise diagnostics is critical. Conventional systems face challenges like prolonged wait times and limited accessibility, impacting patient care and burdening resources. Enter Diagnosia, an innovative platform revolutionizing diagnostics. Utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as AI and machine learning, Diagnosia aims to bridge gaps in healthcare delivery.

# Features [`↩`](#jumpto)


### Symptom Checker
Dataset is provided by **[Columbia University](https://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html)**  and is a knowledge database of disease-symptom associations generated by an automated method based on information in textual discharge summaries of patients at New York Presbyterian Hospital admitted during 2004.  The first column shows the disease, the second the number of discharge summaries containing a positive and current mention of the disease, and the associated symptom. Associations for the 150 most frequent diseases based on these notes were computed and the symptoms are shown ranked based on the strength of association

### Skin Cancer Detection
Dataset is provided by **[Harvard Health](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T)** and is a dataset of 10,000+ images of various different types of skin cancer, namely: Basal cell carcinoma, Dermatofibroma, Melanoma, Melanocytic nevi, Vascular lesions, Benign keratosis-like lesions, Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinom.

### DocFinder
We have geocoded doctors data from all over India by **[Google Maps](https://maps.google.com)** to display doctor pins on the map itself.

### VisionTracker
Due to the increased work from home oppurtunities, many of us fail to maintain a good eye level, which is why we have implemented a full fledged vision tracking system to tell the user if their eye level is good or bad.
